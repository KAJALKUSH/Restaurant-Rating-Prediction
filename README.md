- listed_in(city) : locality of the restaurant position


## Zomato Bangalore Data EDA

### Overview

The objective of this project is to for CRISP-DM Process while providing data solution.

The CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) can be summarised as:

Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Prepare Data
Data Modeling
Evaluate the Results
Deploy
We will follow below steps to do that:

Pick a dataset.

Pose at least three questions related to business or real-world applications of how the data could be used.

Create a Jupyter Notebook, using any associated packages you'd like, to: Prepare data:

Gather necessary data to answer your questions Handle categorical and missing data Provide insight into the methods you chose and why you chose them Analyze, Model, and Visualize

Communicate your business insights.
